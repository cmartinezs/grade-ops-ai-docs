# API Design

GradeOps AI API should be simple, auditable, and workflow-oriented.

The API must support the MVP assessment lifecycle, agent orchestration, teacher review, evidence extraction, and plan/usage tracking.

## API Design Principles

1. Prefer workflow commands over broad automation endpoints.
2. Keep teacher approval explicit.
3. Return structured IDs for every generated artifact.
4. Make agent operations observable.
5. Keep student-facing outputs pending until approved.
6. Separate internal evidence APIs from teacher-facing APIs.
7. Make every mutation auditable.
8. Support demo and pilot use before enterprise completeness.

## API Style

Recommended MVP style:

- REST API;
- JSON request/response;
- authenticated teacher/operator access;
- server-side Gemini calls only;
- idempotency support for long-running commands where possible;
- pagination for list endpoints;
- consistent error response.

Base path:

```text
/api/v1
```

## Student Submission API Meaning

In this API, `/submissions` means **student submissions**: answers, code, files, attempts, or delivered work loaded by the teacher for a specific assessment.

It does not imply student accounts or a student portal.

A submission becomes a **graded submission** for pricing/usage when it is analyzed by the grading/feedback workflow.

## Long-Running Operations

For batch operations:

1. command endpoint returns run ID;
2. UI polls run status;
3. backend stores partial results;
4. failures are visible.

## API State Rules

| Command | Required State |
| --- | --- |
| Generate rubric | Assessment draft exists. |
| Approve rubric | Rubric pending review. |
| Add submissions | Assessment `ready_for_submissions` or later. |
| Start grading | Approved rubric + submissions. |
| Generate feedback | Grading suggestions exist. |
| Approve feedback | Feedback draft exists. |
| Generate report | Grading/feedback/gap data exists. |
| Export report | Report exists. |

## API Acceptance Criteria

The API is sufficient when it supports end-to-end assessment creation, rubric generation and approval, submission intake, grading agent execution, teacher review, feedback approval, learning gap/recovery generation, teacher report generation, agent log retrieval, evidence dashboard retrieval, and usage limit tracking.
