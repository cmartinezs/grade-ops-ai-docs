# Assessment Modes

GradeOps AI supports two assessment modes that share the same operational infrastructure but differ in question type, grading mechanism, and AI role.

The choice of mode is made by the teacher when creating an assessment. Both modes produce a `GradeResult` associated with a student, an assessment, and a subject.

## Modes

| Dimension | Open Assessment | Closed Assessment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Response type | Code, text, development, file, extended answer | Selection of alternatives (TF, single choice, multiple choice) |
| Assessment generation | AI generates context, case, instructions, deliverables, and rubric | AI generates questions, alternatives, answer key, difficulty, and learning outcomes |
| Grading mechanism | AI suggests score against approved rubric; teacher approves | Deterministic engine compares against frozen answer key; teacher reviews exceptions |
| AI role in grading | Interpretive, uncertain, subject to approval | Structural: generate and validate; deterministic at scoring time |
| Main control checkpoint | Rubric approval + grading suggestion approval | Question curation approval + answer key approval |
| Primary risk | Subjectivity, rubric ambiguity, inconsistency | Bad answer key, ambiguous distractors, mismatch between question and snapshot |
| Best use | Practical programming tasks, code review, open-ended problems | Conceptual checks, quick knowledge verification, theory assessment |
| Teacher workload | High: review grading suggestion per student | Low: review exceptions only; review analytics after |

## Common Assessment Lifecycle

Both modes share this base lifecycle:

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
  [*] --> draft
  draft --> pending_teacher_review : AI output ready
  pending_teacher_review --> approved : Teacher approves
  pending_teacher_review --> draft : Teacher regenerates
  approved --> published : Teacher publishes
  published --> accepting_responses : Teacher opens
  accepting_responses --> responses_received : Responses arrive
  responses_received --> grading_in_progress : Grading starts
  grading_in_progress --> pending_teacher_review : Grading suggestions/results ready
  pending_teacher_review --> graded : Teacher confirms
  graded --> results_published : Teacher publishes results
  results_published --> archived
```

## Open Assessment Specifics

  E[Students receive link or submit via teacher]

  G[Feedback Agent drafts feedback]
  H[Learning Gap Agent summarizes cohort gaps]
  I[Teacher reviews and approves all outputs]
  J[Results and feedback published]

  A --> B --> C --> D --> E --> F --> G --> H --> I --> J
```

### AI Role in Open Assessments

The AI generates, interprets, and suggests. The teacher validates every output that reaches a student.

| Step | AI Action | Teacher Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Assessment creation | Generates draft | Approves or edits |
| Rubric | Generates criteria and weights | Approves before grading |
| Grading | Suggests score per criterion with evidence | Approves, edits, or rejects |
| Feedback | Drafts student-facing text | Approves before delivery |
| Learning gaps | Summarizes cohort patterns | Confirms instructional relevance |
| Recovery | Suggests reinforcement activity | Approves before use |

## Closed Assessment Specifics

```mermaid

  A[Teacher defines evaluative intent]
  B[Question Generation Agent produces question batch]
  C[Distractor Quality Agent reviews alternatives]
  D[Ambiguity Review Agent checks questions]
  E[Teacher reviews and approves questions]
  F[Approved questions enter the Question Bank]
  G[Teacher or Assessment Assembly Agent composes evaluation]
  H[Teacher approves composition and scoring policy]
  I[System creates snapshot and publishes]
  J[Students receive access link]
  K[Students respond]
  L[Deterministic grading engine scores against answer key]
  M[Teacher reviews exceptions and analytics]
  N[Teacher publishes results]
  O[Item Analytics Agent analyzes post-assessment performance]

  A --> B --> C --> D --> E --> F --> G --> H --> I --> J --> K --> L --> M --> N --> O
```

### AI Role in Closed Assessments

The AI generates and validates structure. Grading is deterministic. The teacher curates, not just approves.

| Step | AI Action | Teacher Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Question generation | Generates questions, alternatives, key, difficulty, outcomes | Approves/edits/rejects each question |
| Distractor quality | Flags weak distractors, bias, imbalance | Reviews flags; may accept or request regeneration |
| Ambiguity check | Flags multiple valid interpretations, missing context | Resolves before approving |
| Assessment composition | Proposes question selection, balance, punchcard, scoring | Approves final composition |
| Grading | No AI involvement; deterministic engine | Reviews exceptions (duplicates, blanks, ambiguous marks) |
| Results narrative | Item Analytics Agent interprets difficulty and gaps | Reviews before sharing |
| Recovery suggestion | Suggests reinforcement based on item analytics | Approves before use |

### Deterministic Grading Rule

For closed assessments, grading must follow this formula and never involve probabilistic AI judgment:

```text
GradeResult =
  student answer(s)
  + snapshot of frozen answer key
  + scoring policy (full credit / partial credit / penalty)
  + grade scale
  = calculated score
```

This is immutable once the assessment snapshot is published.

## Question Bank

The closed assessment mode requires a question bank. The bank is AI-native: questions are generated by agents, curated by the teacher, and versioned by the system.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
  [*] --> ai_generated
  ai_generated --> pending_review
  pending_review --> approved
  pending_review --> rejected
  approved --> active
  active --> needs_revision
  needs_revision --> pending_review
  active --> retired
  active --> versioned : New version created
```

| State | Meaning | Usable in assessment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ai_generated` | Created by AI, not yet reviewed | No |
| `pending_review` | Awaiting teacher curation | No |
| `approved` | Teacher validated content, alternatives, and key | Yes |
| `active` | In bank and available | Yes |
| `needs_revision` | Has warnings or was flagged as ambiguous | No (unless confirmed) |
| `retired` | Blocked from future use; historical only | No |
| `rejected` | Discarded | No |
| `versioned` | Has a newer version; this version is historical | No as current |

## Snapshot Rule

When a closed assessment is published, the system must freeze:

- all questions;
- all alternatives with their order and labels;
- the answer key;
- the scoring policy;
- the grade scale.

This snapshot cannot be changed after the assessment starts. Changes require a new assessment version and a new assessment run. Any recalculation after the fact must be audited and logged.

## Mode Selection

When a teacher creates an assessment, they select the mode:

```text
Create assessment
  -> Open (practical / code)
  -> Closed (objectives / alternatives)
```

The selection determines:
- which agents run;
- which intake flow is used;
- how grading works;
- which reports are generated.

Mixed mode (open + closed in one assessment) is deferred to a future version.

## Result Model

Both modes produce the same result structure for the student:

| Field | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `assessment_id` | UUID | Parent assessment |
| `learner_ref_id` | UUID | Student reference |
| `raw_score` | numeric | Points obtained |
| `weighted_score` | numeric | Applied to subject weighting |
| `final_grade` | numeric | Converted using grade scale |
| `grading_status` | enum | `calculated`, `teacher_approved`, `published_to_student` |
| `teacher_approved_by` | UUID | Nullable |
| `published_at` | timestamp | When student can see result |
