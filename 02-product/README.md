# 02 Product

This folder defines what the MVP must do for users.

It answers:

> What does the product experience need to include to prove the business and support a credible demo?

## Essence

`02-product` turns the project and business strategy into product behavior:

- MVP scope (two assessment modes: open and closed);
- personas;
- user stories;
- workflows;
- assessment modes and their specific flows;
- student access model;
- response intake channels;
- curriculum and subject structure;
- product metrics.

The folder is intentionally product-focused. It describes user experience, states, flows, priorities, and acceptance criteria without becoming backend architecture.

## How To Use This Folder

Use these files to drive product planning and implementation:

1. `mvp-scope.md` — what is in scope, out of scope, and required for the demo; scope matrix with priorities.
2. `personas.md` — users, buyers, operators, reviewers, and anti-personas.
3. `user-stories.md` — backlog by epic, priority, and acceptance criteria (Epics 1–13).
4. `workflows.md` — end-to-end workflows for open and closed assessment, approval states, failure flows, and evidence flow.
5. `assessment-modes.md` — open vs. closed assessment comparison, shared lifecycle, AI role per mode, question bank states, and snapshot rule.
6. `student-access.md` — student (LearnerRef) model, secure link types, invitation flow, what students can see, and security rules.
7. `response-intake.md` — digital (P0) and physical paper (P1) intake channels, OCR vs OMR, conflict resolution, and normalization to AssessmentAttempt.
8. `curriculum-structure.md` — subject/topic/learning-outcome taxonomy; P0 string tagging; P1 structured model with CurriculumNode and LearningObjective; AI-generated curriculum; Chile pack reference.
9. `metrics.md` — product, business, AI-native operations, trust, and hackathon evidence metrics.

## What Belongs Here

- User needs.
- Product flows.
- Acceptance criteria.
- MVP boundaries.
- Product lifecycle states.
- Product and activation metrics.
- Mermaid diagrams for product workflows.

## What Does Not Belong Here

- Detailed API endpoints.
- Prompt templates.
- Infrastructure choices.
- Sales scripts.
- Financial ledgers.
- Raw technical exploration.

## Diagram Rule

Product diagrams must use Mermaid by default. Use PlantUML only when Mermaid cannot express the diagram clearly. Use ASCII only as a last fallback.
