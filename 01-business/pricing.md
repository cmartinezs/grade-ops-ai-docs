# Pricing

GradeOps AI pricing must validate business value while protecting margins from unbounded AI usage.

The pricing model is based on assessment operations and graded student submissions, not unlimited access.

## Pricing Principles

- Price by value and usage volume, not only API cost.
- Never sell unlimited AI grading.
- Keep plans simple enough for a hackathon demo.
- Make the first paid offer easy to buy.
- Use a paid pilot to validate willingness to pay.
- Track cost per assessment, graded student submission, active teacher, and customer.
- Separate free-tier/credit benefits from real unit economics.
- Separate related-party revenue from arms-length revenue.

## Definition Of Graded Submission

A **graded submission** is the unit consumed by the plans.

It means:

> One student answer, attempt, code file, pasted response, or delivered work item processed by the AI-assisted grading and feedback workflow.

It does **not** mean a student account.

Examples:

| Scenario | Counted Usage |
| --- | ---: |
| 30 students submit 1 answer each | 30 graded submissions |
| 10 students submit 3 exercises each | 30 graded submissions |
| 1 student submits 2 attempts and both are analyzed | 2 graded submissions |
| Teacher creates an assessment but no answers are analyzed | 0 graded submissions |

For MVP pricing, student login is not required. The teacher can upload or paste student responses. The cost driver is the number and size of responses processed, not the number of registered learners.

## Business Unit

Primary unit:

> 1 assessment = activity + rubric + grading assistance for 30 student submissions + personalized feedback + teacher report.

Primary cost drivers:

- number of submissions;
- length/complexity of submissions;
- model routing;
- retries/failures;
- premium fallback usage;
- teacher report generation;
- storage/logging;
- support/onboarding time.

## Recommended Public Pricing

| Plan | Price | Included Usage | Best For |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| Free | US$0 | 1 assessment / 30 graded submissions | Controlled demo and lead capture |
| Teacher Lite | US$12/month | 3 assessments / 90 graded submissions | Tutor or low-volume educator |
| Teacher Pro | US$29/month | 10 assessments / 300 graded submissions | Main individual teacher plan |
| Cohort Pro | US$79/month | 30 assessments / 1,000 graded submissions | Bootcamps, tutors, small academies |
| Pilot Pack | US$99 one-time | 3 real assessments / up to 150 graded student submissions / onboarding | Best hackathon revenue offer |

## LatAm / Chile Testing Prices

These prices can be tested locally while reporting hackathon revenue in USD equivalent.

| Plan | Suggested CLP Price |
| --- | ---: |
| Teacher Lite | $9.990 CLP/month |
| Teacher Pro | $19.990-$24.990 CLP/month |
| Cohort Pro | $59.990-$79.990 CLP/month |
| Pilot Pack | $39.990-$79.990 CLP one-time |

For hackathon validation, the Pilot Pack matters more than perfect subscription optimization.

## Overuse Pricing

| Extra Usage | Suggested Price |
| --- | ---: |
| Additional graded submission | US$0.08 |
| Additional assessment without submissions | US$0.50 |
| Additional assessment with up to 30 submissions | US$3.00 |
| Additional advanced report | US$1.00 |
| Premium model review | US$0.20-US$0.50 per submission |

Overuse should be logged and visible to the customer before it becomes a billing surprise.

## Margin Logic

Gross margin formula:

```text
Gross margin =
(Revenue - AI runtime - cloud runtime - storage/logging - payment fees - support allocation) / Revenue
```

Minimum planning targets:

| Offer | Target Gross Margin |
| --- | ---: |
| Free | Negative or break-even, capped hard |
| Teacher Lite | 70%+ |
| Teacher Pro | 75%+ |
| Cohort Pro | 70%+ |
| Pilot Pack | 60%+ after onboarding/support time |

The Pilot Pack can have lower margin because it generates evidence, testimonials, workflow learning, and revenue proof.

## Example Margin Thinking

If a 30-submission assessment costs roughly US$0.50-US$1.20 in AI usage with efficient routing, the technical AI cost is not the main price anchor.

The price anchor is customer value:

- hours saved;
- feedback consistency;
- faster student support;
- report generation;
- lower need for additional academic operations labor;
- trust and auditability.

However, technical costs still matter because long code submissions, retries, premium fallbacks, and support time can change margins quickly.

## Pricing Validation Questions

Ask during discovery:

- How often do you run practical programming assessments?
- How many submissions do you usually review?
- How many hours does grading/feedback take?
- What would saving 3-5 hours per assessment be worth?
- Would you rather pay per assessment, per month, or per submission volume?
- Is a guided Pilot Pack easier to approve than a subscription?
- Which price feels too cheap to trust?
- Which price feels expensive but possible?
- Which price is clearly too expensive?
- Who would approve payment?

## Discount Policy

Discounts should not destroy signal quality.

Allowed:

- founder-led pilot discount;
- education/community discount;
- limited-time hackathon pilot price.

Avoid:

- unlimited lifetime deals;
- free unlimited pilots;
- hidden discounts that make revenue evidence unclear;
- discounts without written scope limits;
- free work for related parties counted as commercial traction.

Always record:

- list price;
- actual paid price;
- reason for discount;
- whether the customer is related-party;
- whether the payment is arms-length.

## Current Pricing Decision

For the hackathon period:

1. Lead with **Pilot Pack**.
2. Keep subscription plans visible but secondary.
3. Limit usage by assessments and graded student submissions.
4. Track overuse but avoid aggressive billing friction early.
5. Report revenue, costs, discounts, and related-party status transparently.
6. Use pricing conversations as customer discovery, not only sales.
